      Create a VPC Access connector.
    DESCRIPTION: |
      Create a new VPC Access connector with the given name.

      This command can fail for the following reasons:
        * An instance with the same name already exists.
        * The active account does not have permission to create instances.
    EXAMPLES: |
      The following command creates a VPC Access connector with name
      `my-vpc-connector` in region `us-central1` in network `my-network` with
      IP CIDR range of `10.132.0.0/28`.

        $ {command} my-vpc-connector --region=us-central1 --network=my-network
          --range=10.132.0.0/28
