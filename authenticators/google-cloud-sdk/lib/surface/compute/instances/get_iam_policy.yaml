    brief: Get the IAM policy for a Google Compute Engine instance.
    DESCRIPTION: |
      *{command}* displays the IAM policy associated with a Google
      Compute Engine instance in a project. If formatted as JSON,
      the output can be edited and used as a policy file for
      set-iam-policy. The output includes an "etag" field
      identifying the version emitted and allowing detection of
      concurrent policy updates; see
      $ {parent} set-iam-policy for additional details.
    EXAMPLES: |
      To print the IAM policy for a given instance, run:

        $ {command} --zone=my-zone my-instance
