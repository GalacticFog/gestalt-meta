    brief: Set the IAM policy for a queue.
    DESCRIPTION: |
      This command replaces the existing IAM policy for a queue, given a queue
      and a file encoded in JSON or YAML that contains the IAM policy. If the
      given policy file specifies an "etag" value, then the replacement will
      succeed only if the policy already in place matches that etag. (An etag
      obtained via `get-iam-policy` will prevent the replacement if the policy
      for the queue has been subsequently updated.) A policy file that does not
      contain an etag value will replace any existing policy for the queue.
